Class Game

This top down class game has loopable gameplay where it gives quests to the player to do. It plays around as the player being a delivery driver and you must deliver
food to those that want it. this game features:
-WASD Movement
-A Speed up tile
-Bumper collisions

this game really just solidified my basic understanding and fundementals of Unity and C#
